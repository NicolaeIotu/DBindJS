# DBindJS
Author IOTU NICOLAE

DBindJS is data binding for Javascript.<br/>
DBindJS has an unique structure, strategy, functionality and original code which cannot be tracked to other libs.

DBindJS is:
* Data Binding Only
* Javascript Only
* Strict Mode Compatible
* ES5 Compatible
* Self Sufficient
* Sync
* Lightweight
* Optimised
* Humans compatible (learn during a break and still feel like during a break)

Contributors are kindly reminded that Javascript is the world's most misunderstood programming language. Should you need to refresh the theory I strongly recommend https://developer.mozilla.org.
