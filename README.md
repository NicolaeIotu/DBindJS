# DBindJS

DBindJS is data binding for Javascript.

DBindJS is my first contribution to the open source community.
I started this project with the idea of making a pure ECMA Script data binding utility.

DBindJS is released under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.<br/>
Released October 2017 DBindJS has unique, original and natural ECMA Script code, structure and strategy.
If for any reason another type of licence is required, or a custom version is required 
please contact the author at nicolae.g.iotu@gmail.com.
 
DBindJS is build on natural ECMA Script. 
You can safely use DBindJS as type, as instance, and even extend the type.
DBindJS structure and/or strategy can be replicated and used in another projects. 
Should you do that, apart from AGPL-3.0 requirements, please provide

## DBindJS 1.0.0

The first release version of DBindJS incorporates a couple of advantages 
over existing Javascript data binding libraries:

* data binding only
* introduced the concept of 'binding pool'
* ease of use: fast learning, intuitive usage
* merged updates
* separation thru namespaces
* advanced fine tuning
* consistent protection
* pause/resume features
